\begin{abstract}
In this project, we aim at classify a much more difficult variation of the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. We adopt feature selection and construction techniques together with four main machine learning algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes, fully connected Feedforward Neural Network, Linear Support Vector Machine, and XXX (name of the 4th algorithm here). We analyze and assess the parameter selection process and the performance of each algorithm. We conclude the report with discussion and suggestions for further improvement.

%-------------------------------------- Introduction  --------------------------------------%
\section{Introduction}
The MNIST database of handwritten digits \cite{mnistlecun} is a standard touchstone of effective image classification algorithms.  It is  extensively studied and tested by many machine learning techniques \cite{Huang:2009:SFD:1704175.1704194, Jou:2004:HNR:1123321.1123360,  726791,  mnistTheano} . The original dataset consists of more than 60,000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9, normalized to a 28x28 fixed image size \cite{mnistlecun}. 

The dataset we are dealing with in this project is more challenging. Modifications of the original dataset include embossing, rotation, rescaling, and texture pattern. These artificial alterations introduce a great amount of noise and undoubtedly increase the  level of difficulty of the digit classification task. The modified dataset contains 50,000 training examples of 48x48 fixed size, and the test set comprises 20,000 instances which require classification \cite{comp598p3}.

We decided to apply four different algorithms: Naive Bayes, Feedforward Neural Networks, Linear Support Vector Machine, and XXX to the modified MNIST dataset. For the baseline algorithm, we chose Gaussian Naive Bayes since features given as float numbers are continuous.  For Neural Networks,......  For Linear SVM, ......  For XXX, ...... (one or two sentences summarizing each algorithm)

The performance of algorithms varies widely. The base line algorithm, Naive Bayes, provides around 40$\%$ accuracy, this may due to the fact that the Naive Bayes assumption does not hold in the digit classification task in general. NN..... . SVM..... XXX..... (one or two sentences summarizing the performance)

Our empirical results, though preliminary, provide considerably accurate predictions (especially XXX) for the modified MNIST digit classification. Thus, we are optimistic of applying the algorithms and analysis presented in this report to other real-world  classification problems. In particular, this can motivate the further study on more specialized machine learning algorithms on image classification tasks.










%-------------------------------------- Data Preprocessing --------------------------------------%
\section{Methodology}
We present detailed descriptions of our methods featuring data preprocessing, feature selection, algorithm selection, and optimization techniques in this section.  We provide theoretical characterizations of our approaches and outline the results of these specific methods. We will illustrate the advantage of our methods using informative graphs and analyze the experimental results in next section.


\subsection{Data Preprocessing Methods}
We adopted different data preprocessing methods based on the characteristic of each machine learning algorithm. Since the dataset was given in a relatively organized format (csv files containing float numbers), we spared little effort to format data or extract numerical data from images. Most data proprecessing methods we used were adapted for a specialized algorithm.

In Naive Bayes, we adopted normalization to  make it suitable for the algorithm. We obtained a set of scaled examples of unit norm after the normalization. We chose L2 norm since it resulted in the greatest improvement in terms of accuracy. We will give more details including the graph showing accuracy versus data preprocessing methods in later section (testing and validation).

\subsection{Feature Design and Selection}
I'm not sure what exactly feature design and selection are. Need more thought on this part.

\subsection{Algorithm Selection}
We chose Gaussian Naive Bayes as the baseline algorithm, fully connected feedforward neural networks, linear support vector machine as required algorithms, together with XXX as the fourth optional algorithm. The following is a brief summary of central ideas of each algorithm.

\subsubsection{Baseline: Gaussian Naive Bayes}
Naive Bayes is one of the simplest machine learning algorithm. The theoretical foundation underlying the algorithm is the Naive Bayes assumption: conditional probabilities are independent of each other \cite{Bishop:2006:PRM:1162264, pineaul5}.

Assume we are provided with $n$ training examples and $m$ features. In discrete case, Bayes rule and Naive Bayes assumption tell us that
\begin{align*}
P(Y | X_1 \cdots X_m ) &= \frac{P(Y) P ( X_1 \cdots X_m| Y )}{P(X_1 \cdots X_m)} &\textrm{by Bayes rule}\\
&= \frac{P(Y) \Pi_{j=1}^m  P ( X_j | Y )}{P(X_1 \cdots X_m)} &\textrm{by NB assumption}
\end{align*}
Hence given a new instance $(X_1\cdots X_m) = (x_1\cdots x_m)$, the predicted label for $(x_1\cdots x_m)$ is
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg \max_{y_i} P(Y = y_i) \Pi_{j=1}^m P(X_j=x_j | Y = y_i) \label{eq:max}
\end{equation}
However, in image classification task, each image is represented by an array of float numbers which can be regarded as real numbers. In order to address the continuous case, we introduce Gaussian Naive Bayes and extend the above formula as follows. We assume $P(X_j=x_j | Y = y_i)$ has a normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean $\mu_{ij}$ and variance $\sigma_{ij}$. Note that while $X_j$ are continuous random variables which can stand for pixel intensities,  $Y$ is a discrete random variable corresponding to labels $1 - 9$.  The probability density function for $P(X_j=x_j | Y = y_i)$ is given below:
\begin{equation}
P(X_j=x_j | Y = y_i) =  f (x_j, \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij} ) =\frac{1}{\sigma_{ij}\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_{ij})^2}{2(\sigma_{ij})^2}} \label{eq:pdf}
\end{equation}
In order to train Gaussian Naive Bayes, we need to approximate $P(Y=y_{i'})$ as well as $\mu_{i'j'}$ and  $\sigma_{i'j'}^2$ for $y_{i'}$ over all labels ($0$ to $9$) and $j'$ ranging from $1$ to $m$ (number of features). 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mu}_{i'j'} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij'} \delta(y_{i}, y_{i'})}{\sum_{i=1}^n \delta(y_{i}, y_{i'})} \label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\hat{\sigma}_{i'j'}^2 =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n ( x_{ij'}-\hat{\mu}_{i'j'})^2 \delta(y_{i}, y_{i'})}{\sum_{i=1}^n \delta(y_{i}, y_{i'})} \label{eq:var}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the Kronecker's delta. It is equal to $1$ if two variables are the same and $0$ otherwise. $x_{ij}$ denotes the $j$th feature in the $i$th  example.


Once we finish estimation of parameters, we use the following equation to predict labels for a given instance $x_1 \cdots x_m$. 
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg \max_{y_i} P(Y = y_i) \Pi_{j=1}^m f (x_j, \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij} ) \label{eq: argmax}
\end{equation}
where $f$ denotes the pdf of the normal distribution.

\subsection{Optimization}
Some algorithms involve maximization or minimization processes. For example, we need to maximize the $P(Y = y_i) \Pi_{j=1}^m f (x_j, \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij} )$ in Naive Bayes. Since the log function is monotonically increasing, it preserves the maximum. Hence, we can maximize the log likelihood as shown in equation (\ref{eq:log}) instead of the original equation (\ref{eq: argmax}) :
\begin{equation}
\arg \max_{y_i} \log P(Y = y_i) + \sum_{j=1}^m \log f (x_j, \mu_{ij}, \sigma_{ij} ) \label{eq:log}
\end{equation}

%-------------------------------------- Testing and Validation --------------------------------------%
\section{Testing and Validation}
In this section, we present detailed experimental results, most of them in terms of graphs. We also evaluate the performance of four algorithms and provide analysis on merits and defects of each of the four algorithms. Our analysis concentrate on hyper-parameter selection and testing and validation results.
